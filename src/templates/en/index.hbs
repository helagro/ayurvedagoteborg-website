                        <strong>Ayurveda is a health system that is becoming increasingly popular in the western world.
                            The reason is that Ayurveda has proven to be very useful</strong> in complementing Western
                        medicine in three vital areas:
                    </p>
                    <p>- treatment of diffuse, unclear symptoms</p>
                    <p>- prevention of diseases</p>
                    <p>- making us feel better and healthier, more energetic and more enthusiastic also when we do not
                        have a disease or specific ailment.</p>
