              <h3>Maharishi Marma Therapy</h3>
              <h4 class="courseSubHeader">with Yvonne or Stefan Lagrosen</h4>
              <p>According to Ayurveda, there are 108 points where the body's energy channels meet and where
                consciousness
                creates the physical body. In marma therapy, an individually chosen selection of these points is gently
                and pleasantly massaged with special essential oils. This means that they are balanced, which leads to
                energy being released and health being strengthened.</p>
              <p>Time required: 45-60 minutes</p>
              <p>Cost: SEK 880</p>

              <h3>Maharishi Gemstone Light Therapy</h3>
              <h4 class="courseSubHeader">with Yvonne or Stefan Lagrosen</h4>
              <p>In Ayurveda, gemstones are considered to have an extraordinary power. The light from them is connected
                to
                our inner light. In Gemstone Light Therapy, the light within us is enlivened by allowing light of
                specific
                frequencies to shine through gemstones on unique places on the body. The result is a balancing act on a
                deep level.</p>
              <p>Time required: 45-60 minutes</p>
              <p>Cost: SEK 1190</p>

              <h4 class="courseSubHeader">with Yvonne or Stefan Lagrosen</h4>
              <p>Essential oils are concentrates of solar energy and the power of plants collected in small bottles.
                They
                revive the body's self-healing ability, create balance and strengthen body and soul. The scents activate
                neurotransmitters that increase well-being and reduce stress, anxiety and depression. During the
                consultation, you will receive a pleasant and enjoyable Ved Aroma treatment, and we will select the
                aroma
                oils that suit you best.</p>
